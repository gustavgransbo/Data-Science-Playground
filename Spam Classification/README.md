# Spam Classification
In this project I explore the spamassassin corpus.
The spamassassin corpus contains emails classified either as `spam` or `ham`, the latter being ordinary non-spam emails.
The data, as well as a description can be found here:

The project is an exercise in working on unstructured data, text processing and some basic machine learning concepts.

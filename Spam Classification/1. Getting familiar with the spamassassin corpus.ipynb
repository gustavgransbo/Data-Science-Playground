AutoSearch--our patent pending tool--continually displays renewed TopSites-us listings on our users’ PCs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We display TopSites-us listings more than 42 million times in an hour. That is why we can guarantee to show your listing more than a million times a year. \n",

And they may not re-list you if there are too many listings in your category. \n",

If your old listing was in the wrong category, you can click unsubscribe to cancel it.\n",

      "Do we have a contract with you?\n",

It maintains a cache, and will avoid stories you've already    read. It can handle 1-page sites, 1-page with diffing, 2- and 3-level sites as well    as My-Netscape-style RSS sites. It's also very easy to add a new site to its list.    Even if you don't have a PalmPilot, it's still handy for simple website-to-text    conversion. Site files are included for many popular news sites including Slashdot,    LWN, Freshmeat and Linux Today.</font><br>\n",

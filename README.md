# Data Science Playground
Some of my data science side projects where I do exploraty data analysis, machine learning etc. Most projects are done in Jupyter Notebooks and for the most part contain lot's of my comments and thoughts.

My focus with these projects is to try out new things and have fun.
For this reason they sometime might have an alomst stream of consciousness flow to them, with me going of on tangents I found interesting at the moment.
They also contain lot's of beginner mistakes and bad practices, as I am often working with techniques and packages that I am new to. 

In no way are these projects intended to be read as guides, as most of the time I am dealing with something I am just starting to learn about.
